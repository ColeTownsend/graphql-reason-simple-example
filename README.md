This is a repo with examples usages of [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react).

Run this project:

```
yarn
# run Reason compiler
yarn start
# in another tab, run webpack
yarn webpack
#in another tab, run the graphql backend
yarn run:server
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
